# Calibration for ECAL 
## $\pi^0$ mass calibration

### Repo description

In this repository we can find all the machinery to perform a ECAL calibration using the invariant mass of the $\pi^0$ invariant mass.
This calibration has special focus on the Gep-V experiment framed in the SuperBigBite (SBS) inside the Hall-A, at Jefferson Lab. The experiment is developed with the aim to measure the ratio of the proton elastic form factors, $G_{E_p}$ and $G_{M_p}$. The experimental set-up consists on one Proton arm (48D48 magnet + Double polarimeter + Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL)) and one electron arm (Electro Calorimeter (ECAL)). We are focused on the ECAL calibration.

For the calibration, a fast reconstruction attempt without tracking was perform. The target is to reconstruct the $\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma$ system, this process is supposed to be generated in the interaction of the electron beam with the nucleon (present in the fixed LH2 target), the photon pair reach the ECAL and leave deposited energy.
